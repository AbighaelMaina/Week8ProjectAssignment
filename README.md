 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

Welcome to the **COVID-19 Global Data Tracker** — a beginner-friendly data analysis project built with 💻 Python, 🐼 pandas, and 📊 beautiful visualizations!

This project explores the spread and impact of COVID-19 across different countries and over time using real-world data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-data). It was designed as a learning project to strengthen data wrangling, analysis, and visualization skills in Python — all wrapped up in a single Jupyter Notebook.

- 🌐 Global trends of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- 📆 Time series analysis of new and total cases
- 📊 Comparative analysis across selected countries (e.g., Kenya 🇰🇪, India 🇮🇳, USA 🇺🇸)
- 💉 Vaccination progress by country
- 📈 Clean and simple visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
